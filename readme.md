pressmud
--------

A Wordpress theme for linking together posts as rooms and objects like an old-style MUD.

You need two custom post types--for rooms and entities. Rooms need to have custom fields with direction names as the key and the post id of what they link to as the value. Entities need to have a 'Location' defined with the room's post id as the value.

Uses Less CSS, Coffeescript, Twitter's Boostrap (Less), Font Awesome and Wordpress's jQuery. No Wordpress plugins are needed.
